# K-Means algorithm

Hello and welcome in my repository!

## Why is this repo for?

I am a student at Le Mans Universit√©, France and this is one of my first project of my master degree.
The goal here is not to get the best implementation using scikit-learn right away, but rather to learn how the algorithm really works under the hood. Hence, I am going to develop it in a Notebook step by step trying to be as clear as possible in the comment.

## What will you find in it

- Implementation of k-means algorithm 
- Loss function $L(A,\mu)=||X-A \cdot \mu||_2^2$
- Verification to count the number of right assignations
- Plot of the converged value of $L(A,\mu)$ for every $k$
- Time comparison between my implementation and the scikit-learn one.
